With the implementation of the Chang hard fork upgrade, Cardano is now under the control of community members. Hoskinson confirmed that his final responsibility is to remove any obstacles to this transition, ensuring that nothing disrupts the process. Additionally, one of the most crucial aspects of initiating the Voltaire Age is the approval of budgets and charters. Despite the urgency, an insider previously accused the Cardano Foundation of delaying the approval process. However, Hoskinson emphasized that these plans must be approved next year. He expressed his commitment to overseeing the achievement of this goal, regardless of any personal, economic, or professional consequences. Hoskinson remains optimistic that the community will soon have the genuine ability to determine Cardano's future, believing that the sacrifices made will ultimately be worthwhile.

The recent speculation surrounding a potential collaboration between Pudgy Penguins and Pokémon has fueled significant excitement among investors. This has added momentum to an already strong uptrend, as the coin continues to attract attention in the meme coin space. With technical indicators showing strong support, PENGU could soon test critical resistance levels and set new price milestones. PENGU Potential Collaboration With Pokémon Could Spark Its Price to $0.10 A recent tweet by Pudgy Penguin holder @broskisol has sparked excitement within the PENGU community. The post hints at rumors of a potential collaboration between Pudgy Penguins and Pokémon, a move that, if confirmed, could significantly elevate the project’s status. This speculation has already stirred interest among holders, with many envisioning the potential impact of such a high-profile partnership. Rumors about Pudgy Penguins and Pokémon collaboration. Source: X Should the collaboration materialize, it could transform PENGU brand and price. Aligning with one of the world’s most recognized entertainment franchises could attract widespread attention, boost demand, and drive the coin’s value higher. In this scenario, PENGU could potentially surge to $0.10 or beyond, marking a historic milestone for the meme coin. However, without confirmation of the rumors, the current excitement may remain speculative. PENGU RSI Shows More Upside Is Possible, But Its Uptrend Needs to Continue Strong PENGU’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 64.6, reflecting strong momentum but staying below the overbought threshold of 70.

In contrast, values below 30 suggest oversold conditions and possible recovery. PENGU RSI.

2025-01-26 17:30:35,BTC,"Dogecoin Appears Poised For Explosive 10,000%  Gain – Analyst Dogecoin (DOGE) has shown some upward mobility in the last day following a rather bearish trading week. Based on data from CoinMarketCap, the premier memecoin remains an investors’ favorite amidst the current bull season with almost 90% of its community confident in future price gains. Notably, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has dropped another bullish prediction on Dogecoin suggesting the token’s potential register a 10,000% price gain. Related Reading: Think Dogecoin Has Topped Out? Two Factors That Say ‘No Way’ Could Dogecoin Repeat Bullish Feat? In a recent post on X, Martinez shared a positive analysis of Dogecoin based on historical price data. According to the crypto pundit, DOGE experienced a 10,000% price gain in the last bull cycle in 2021. During this period, the memecoin’s value increased from around $0.007 to $0.700 within 98 days. Looking at DOGE’s current trading chart, the cryptocurrency presents a similar situation to when the price surge began in 2021. Martinez’s predictions indicate if Dogecoin is able to mirror such robust bullish movement, it could attain a market price of $14.78 by May 2025. As earlier stated, bullish sentiments around Dogecoin are currently heightened creating significant potential for this highly favorable scenario. A substantial portion of this positive market sentiment is centered around the possibility of a Dogecoin Spot ETF. Amidst the many developments in the past week, prominent asset manager Bitwise has filed a proposal for a “Bitwise Dogecoin ETF” to the Division of Corporation, US Department of State, Delaware. NewsBTC reports that Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has also confirmed the authenticity of the proposed DOGE Spot ETF which “is likely coming soon”. Interestingly, Ali Martinez previously predicted the Dogecoin spot ETF can serve as a positive market driver pushing DOGE’s prices to around $15 in line with his most recent price forecast. These projections are based on the nature of the Spot ETF which is designed to attract institutional demand as seen with Bitcoin. Related Reading: Still Waiting For An Altcoin Season? These Metrics Show Why It Might Never Happen DOGE Price Overview At press time, Dogecoin is valued at $0.354 after a 1.72% gain in the past day. On the other, its daily trading volume is down by 30.09% indicating decreasing investor activity. On larger timeframes, DOGE reflects an 11.43% loss on its 7-day chart but an impressive 13.96% profit on its monthly chart indicates an overall positive performance In recent weeks. For short-term traders, a crypto analyst with X username Kev_Capita_TA believes Dogecoin may be entering an upward consolidation phase that is likely to last till early February. During this period, the market expert warns it is important for market bulls to avoid a price breakdown as DOGE could potentially fall as low as $0.26. Dogecoin, with a market cap of $52.43 billion, holds the title of the largest memecoin and is the seventh-largest cryptocurrency globally.

Looking at DOGE’s current trading chart, the cryptocurrency presents a similar situation to when the price surge began in 2021. Martinez’s predictions indicate if Dogecoin is able to mirror such robust bullish movement, it could attain a market price of $14.78 by May 2025. As earlier stated, bullish sentiments around Dogecoin are currently heightened creating significant potential for this highly favorable scenario. A substantial portion of this positive market sentiment is centered around the possibility of a Dogecoin Spot ETF. Amidst the many developments in the past week, prominent asset manager Bitwise has filed a proposal for a “Bitwise Dogecoin ETF” to the Division of Corporation, US Department of State, Delaware. NewsBTC reports that Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has also confirmed the authenticity of the proposed DOGE Spot ETF which “is likely coming soon”. Interestingly, Ali Martinez previously predicted the Dogecoin spot ETF can serve as a positive market driver pushing DOGE’s prices to around $15 in line with his most recent price forecast. These projections are based on the nature of the Spot ETF which is designed to attract institutional demand as seen with Bitcoin. Related Reading: Still Waiting For An Altcoin Season? These Metrics Show Why It Might Never Happen DOGE Price Overview At press time, Dogecoin is valued at $0.354 after a 1.72% gain in the past day. On the other, its daily trading volume is down by 30.09% indicating decreasing investor activity. On larger timeframes, DOGE reflects an 11.43% loss on its 7-day chart but an impressive 13.96% profit on its monthly chart indicates an overall positive performance In recent weeks. For short-term traders, a crypto analyst with X username Kev_Capita_TA believes Dogecoin may be entering an upward consolidation phase that is likely to last till early February. During this period, the market expert warns it is important for market bulls to avoid a price breakdown as DOGE could potentially fall as low as $0.26. Dogecoin, with a market cap of $52.43 billion, holds the title of the largest memecoin and is the seventh-largest cryptocurrency globally.

2025-02-17 21:00:12,BTC,"XRP Set To Outshine Gold? Analyst Predicts 1,000% Surge A well-known analyst made an intriguing assumption about the rise of XRP, saying that it could potentially outdo the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index. Egrag Crypto predicted that XRP could rise by 1,000% against the gold and silver index as the analyst sees the crypto replicating a run it made in 2017. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $1.35? Analyst Predicts Milestone ‘Within 70 Days’ A Looming Crypto Run In a post, market analyst Egrag Crypto noted that indicators are showing that the altcoin could potentially make a bull run similar to what it did in 2017, saying that it could have a big run that would allow it to outperform the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index. “XRP / XAU: 1000% Possible Candle?” the prominent analyst said in his X account. #XRP / #XAU: 1000% Possible Candle? 🔥 Not many analyze the #XRP / #XAU pair, but the chart looks primed for a bounce!

Current Setup Mirrors 2017 Rally Egrag added that the current XRP’s condition might be similar to that of its 2017 run. “I theorize that the three green candles we saw in 2017 have been replicated, albeit with a different degree of growth. We are currently in a ranging mode; the arrow chart suggests we may stay in this range if current price action aligns,” the analyst noted. For clarity, the gold and silver index is being traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which tracks the stocks of 30 precious metal mining firms. Moreover, this index trades with the ticker XAU, which is the same ticker for gold ounces. XRP Could Hit $28.5 Egrag said in its previous run in 2017, the pattern allowed XRP to soar by 1,000% in the XRP/XAU pair, saying that at the moment, the pair is being traded at $893.9 million. The figure was obtained by dividing the altcoin’s current market capitalization of $149.64 billion by the current price of the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index of $167.39. The market analyst believed that if XRP would repeat the 1,000% spike while $167.39 is the price of the index, it would push the price of the XRP/XAU pair to $9.83 billion. With such value, the XRP market capitalization would be at $1.64 trillion, supposing the index remains at $167.39, leading to XRP being traded at $28.5. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Accumulate—Will This Push BTC Toward $100K? Altcoin Bounces Off Egrag noted that XRP price versus XAU seems to have bounced beyond the equilibrium phase, recovering from a massive collapse this month that saw XRP slide to $1.7. “Nice Bounce: #XRP / #XAU has bounced forcefully from the equilibrium stage. A similar bounce occurred at the 7 EMA (Exponential Moving Average), indicating bullish momentum,” the market analyst said in a post.

2025-03-03 18:30:37,BTC,"Bitcoin Open Interest Crashed To 6-Month Low, Here’s What Followed The Last Time Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has revealed that Bitcoin’s open interest has crashed to a six-month low. The analyst further explained what happened the last time this low open interest occurred while providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. Bitcoin’s Open Interest Crashes To 6-Month Low In an X post, CrediBULL Crypto revealed that Bitcoin’s open interest is at the lowest levels it has been at in six months. He noted that the BTC price was trading between $50,000 and $60,000 the last time the open interest was this low. The analyst also revealed that Bitcoin’s funding rate just ticked negative. He also noted that the same thing happened while the flagship crypto was trading between $50,000 and $60,000 just before its rally to $100,000. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Who Correctly Called The Bitcoin Price Surge From $15,400 To $100,000 Reveals What’s Next Interestingly, CrediBULL Crypto asserted that these metrics overall look “fantastic” for Bitcoin and further solidified his belief that the flagship crypto has formed a bottom. Indeed, BTC looks to have formed a bottom as the flagship crypto has rebounded to as high as $95,000 following its drop below $80,000 last week. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also suggested that the Bitcoin price has found its bottom. In an X post, he noted that historically, BTC tends to rebound when the daily Relative Strength Index drops below 30. He then revealed that the RSI was sitting at 24, indicating that the flagship crypto had bottomed out and was well due for a rebound. BTC Needs To Hold Above This Range To Confirm Reversal However, despite Bitcoin’s rebound to as high as $95,000, CrediBULL Crypto suggested that market participants shouldn’t get too excited yet. He stated that the pump doesn’t mean much unless BTC clears the key resistance at around $93,000. The analyst remarked that moving up to this range was the easy part but “strength” is getting past it. Related Reading: Bitcoin $166,000 Target Still In Play? The Extension That Determines Where Price Goes Next Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also echoed a similar sentiment. He stated that Bitcoin is currently pushing through $94,000, breaking above the Kumo cloud. The analyst added that the flagship crypto needs to stay above this price level before the reversal can be confirmed. However, Titan of Crypto still provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price, suggesting that a reintegration might be about to occur, which could send the flagship crypto into a markup phase. His accompanying chart showed that BTC could rally above $126,000 as it enters this markup phase. Meanwhile, Martinez revealed that the Bitcoin bull run remains intact according to the aSORP indicator. He also stated that global liquidity is on the rise again, and with BTC lagging behind this metric, the analyst remarked that this could signal a unique buying opportunity. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $91,000, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-03-07 23:00:45,BTC,"Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds The recent Bitcoin price crash below $90,000 came as a shock to the broader crypto community, especially amid expectations of a continued bull market rally. Despite the volatility and ongoing declines, a crypto analyst projects an even greater crash, suggesting that Bitcoin could fall as low as $63,000 if a certain resistance level holds. TradingView crypto analyst Alixjey has declared that the Bitcoin price must break past $99,500 to continue moving higher. He highlights that if this resistance holds and Bitcoin fails to break it, the pioneer cryptocurrency will likely face a steeper price decline to new lows of $63,000. The last time Bitcoin was around the $60,000 range was during its massive price rally in 2024 after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Considering that Bitcoin has risen as high as $104,000 at one point this year, a crash toward $60,000 would be a devastating blow to investors and its market. Bitcoin Price Crash Imminent The TradingView analyst shared a chart suggesting that Bitcoin could rise as high as $106,000 or drop toward the $60,000 to $65,000 range if it fails to break resistance. This price drop is highlighted as a strong buying and accumulation opportunity for long-term investors, as it presents a low entry point into the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin 77% Correction To $25,000, Will History Repeat Itself During its price highs, many retail investors were likely unable to buy Bitcoin due to its increasing cost. Most accumulations were from whales who had purchased millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in one swoop. Alixjey has also labeled his projected $60,000 – $65,000 downturn as the last chance to re-enter the Bitcoin market, emphasizing that it was a prime HODLing point for potential profits in Q3 and Q4 of 2025. This implies that the analyst anticipates a price rebound in Bitcoin later in the year. Moving on, the TradingView expert highlighted two liquidity levels in the 4-hour timeframe that are likely to be cleared soon. He also acknowledged that he was solely bearish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, indicating that his projected short-term pullback will not be invalidated unless the cryptocurrency crosses the resistance between $94,000 and $98,000. Other factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s already heightened volatility are the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. AlixJey predicts that once released, this data could lead to high volatility in both stocks and crypto. He urges investors and traders to be cautious, as major economic reports often influence market movements. Analyst Sees Upside Potential After BTC Crashes Due to Bitcoin’s recent declines, many analysts have shared bearish projections of the cryptocurrency, expecting a severe price correction before a potential recovery. One such analyst is Herbert Sim, the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of AICean. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Suffers Bearish Deviation After Filling CME Gap, Is This Good Or Bad? Sim projects that Bitcoin will crash to new lows, especially with the recent approval of a crypto reserve in the United States (US). He expects a crash to $40,000 but highlights that it will be short-lived, spanning from weeks, months, and possibly years. However, the AICean CMO suggested that investors who can HODL for the long-term are likely to see more profits once BTC rebounds from bearish trends.

This recovery comes amid rising network activity, with the number of new and daily active addresses recording growth during the review period. Cardano Network Activity Strengthens On-chain data has revealed a steady uptick in ADA’s demand over the past week, reflected by its climbing daily active address count.

Through it, treasury funds from transaction fees and inflation are allocated democratically to community proposals. Also, unlike the Ethereum network, which still relies on offchain governance for major upgrades, Cardano aims to transition entirely to onchain governance. The Plomin hard fork that took place on Jan. 29 marked the transition to “full decentralized governance,” according to the Cardano Foundation.

The remaining 14 billion ADA were reserved for gradual release through minting. With 0.3% of ADA reserves distributed as rewards every five days, ADA inflation declines as reserves deplete.

As a result, ADA’s limited usage within the crypto ecosystem raises concerns about its long-term value.According to Messari’s Q4 2024 State of Cardano report, the blockchain processed an average of 71,500 daily transactions, with 42,900 daily active addresses.

Not A Far-Fetched Idea—Analysis Resistance Levels The crypto expert explained that XRP is currently sitting in a price channel that will influence where it will be heading, adding that the crypto’s price is near $2.83, a critical level that could project strength. The analyst said that once XRP hits that level, this might propel the cryptocurrency to move towards $4.20 in the near term but if the coin fails to have a firm grip above the current levels, it might test support levels below. According to the analyst, $2.40, which was the previous day’s high, and $2.97, which was the week’s high, are two key levels to keep an eye on.
